This directory contains fair initializations for *continuous-time* samplers, which are generated by burning
in the sampler for a very long time and taking the last state in the chain. The reason that this is necessary is that
our implementation of MJ samplers is really running the embedded Markov chain, which has a *different* stationary
distribution than the full jump process. In particular, they are related by a similarity transform. There is
an analytic transformation between the two, but it would involve marginalizing over dwell time and would
almost certainly introduce a ton of variance. So this is the easiest way to go.

Each distribution contains an initialization for *each* setting of its hyperparameters. Refer to the documentation
on mjhmc.misc.distributions.Distribution for details.
